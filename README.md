## Gesture Controlled Cobot

This is a project in development as part of curriculum for Arizona State University EGR 550, Mechatronic Systems.

In this project, I want to control certain mechatronic parts and a 6DoF robotic arm using gestures and poses extracted from video stream as recorded by my webcam.
I will be using a myCobot 280 M5, which will be controlled using skeletal gesture data of my body which will be captured by the robot.

In the first stage, I control a fan's speed using my finger tips. Turning it on and off with specific gestures. I the next stage, I will be controlling a light color using my body pose. Eventually in the third stage, I will be controlling a 6DoF robot according to the movements of my arm.
